The location procedure is based on 'scene' and 'unknow' repositories.
We first drive robot to establish the surroundings. During the mapping process,
 recognition is carried out to generate semantic relationships(xy.txt). 
Then the robot randomly locates at a position on the map, conducts an environmental scan of the location and performs matching.
